 With the t-test for two independent samples, we are not in the same territory as we are with the statistical induction from the experiment on the lady tasting tea. There we had a clear hypothesis and a clearer probabilistic approach to test the hypothesis. With the t-test, we depend heavily on the theoretical distributions. This may occasionally lead to some awkward intuitions.
